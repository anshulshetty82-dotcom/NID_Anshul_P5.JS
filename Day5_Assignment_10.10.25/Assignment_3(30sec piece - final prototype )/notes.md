## _Title_ - Trial of the night.


The Trial of the Night is a game about a bad dream in which the player is having a conversation with his inner voice, the happy man (the overman) and his conscious self (reflected by the player's action). The game talks about darker themes of desire and overcoming your fears. The "overman" as coined by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche - talks about it  as a goal for humanity to strive for, representing a being who overcomes traditional morality and creates their own values and meaning in life. Key aspects include self-creation, the complete affirmation of life, and the rejection of external authority like religion or social norms, which is often illustrated metaphorically as the transformation from a camel to a lion to a child.


I find the overman concept very interesting, and wanted players to experience what Nietzsche is talking about. The experience is put in a narrative form by setting the story in a trial within the player's dream. The happy man (the overman) - is the judge of this domain/trail who is overlooking the player and the action he takes. There are also these other voices in the background (the inner voice) which is integral to the narrative experience, these voices (the inner voice) which can be good or bad, keep whispering to the player as he progresses though the level, planting the seeds of thoughts in the players mind. It's up to the player to decide which path to traverse on, based on what he feels is the best choice.

> Regarding the code -
I have explored the code by making prototypes, with dummy sprites and background sheets. please refer to - prototype -1 and prototype 2.
For the structure of the code itself I took help of Ai to understand how to code game states, as the game has levels for the player to traverse through.
